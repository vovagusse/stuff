print('''

1)Tuples with "_" as empty space and a * as a player
2)Def's. A lot of them. to go right, left, up, down
3)Input number "n" is making the grid "n" by "n" steps, each step represents a part of a tuple. 
So to make it i should set the 1st tuple's 0th digit equal to "*" and the 1 to n-1 digit equal to "_" 
4) Typing whether to go any direction should be "goto_dir = goto_dir.lower()" or smth.... i dunno
5) Going outside of the grid should be like in pacman lol
6) After each movement the algorithm should rerender the grid with the player
moved the typed direction... also, "end" execution should turn an iterable "game" from
"game = True"
to
"game = False"

while game = True:
    {blah blah blah}
else print("okay bro thanks for using my little program")

like that:

Grid's side (its a square): 5
Here's the grid you've made!
* _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ 
_ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ 
_ _ _ _ _
Where to go? right
_ * _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ 
_ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ 
_ _ _ _ _
Where to go? up
_ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ 
_ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ 
_ * _ _ _
Where to go? end
okay bro thanks for using my little program
